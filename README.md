# buildREnv

*   On the Advanced Analytics Workspace, consider building an environment for R
    by running __run-conda-install.sh__ in this repository.

    This may avoid certain dependency conflicts, issues that cannot be resolved
    automatically by __base::install.packages()__

    This may also speed up the R package installation process.

*   Consult the __.Rprofile__ regarding how to automatically load the resulting
    environment each time R is launched.
